    "As we want to find insights to improve and guide decisions and underwriting criteria, we want features to help make better prediction for whether a person is able to repay the loan and the probability of default. I believe when we are personally thinking about lending money to someone, there are traits that can boost our confidence for the borrowers repaying the money and there are red flags that would make us hesitate to lend money to some people. Here are some characters that I would look at before lending money to someone and I will use this as a guideline and to see if some of those can be quantified with the data sets that we have.\n",
